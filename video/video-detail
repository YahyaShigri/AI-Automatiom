## 🎥 Admission Automation Demo

This project showcases an **AI-powered admission file filtering workflow** built with **n8n automation**.  
It automatically collects student data from Google Forms, sorts it by percentage, filters applicants based on merit (above or below 50%), and organizes them in Airtable — making the admission process faster and error-free.
